# The-Z-Search
Practicing safe web-scrapping with python 3.0.
  This simple python script accepts a name that exists on wikipedia, scraps it's wiki page, gets all the related links & saves them on command.
  _____________________________
  Important note : Wikipedia allows bot access but not to when the bot is 'going too fast' according them. If what you is all of the contents of Wikipedia then there's no point trying to scrape Wikipedia since Wikipedia already made provision for the download of all of the content of Wikipedia.
